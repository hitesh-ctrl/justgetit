GET | MIT Campus Thrift Marketplace
GET is a hyper-local, peer-to-peer thrift platform exclusively designed for the students of Madras Institute of Technology (MIT), Chromepet. It facilitates the buying, selling, and requesting of pre-owned items within the campus ecosystem.

🚀 The Concept
The name GET stands for the simplicity of acquiring what you need on campus. Unlike general marketplaces, GET is built with campus safety and student convenience in mind, featuring a predetermined chat system to eliminate spam and verified pickup zones to ensure safe transactions.

✨ Key Features
🛒 Marketplace & Bargaining
List Items: Students can upload photos of books, electronics, or lab gear.
